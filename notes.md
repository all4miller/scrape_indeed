Rough Idea

I want to keep a list of companies hiring for JS or Ruby devs in the Atlanta
area.  In 3 months when I am ready to start looking I will use that list as a guide.
Essentially automate my current process: look through indeed job alerts and add
company names to google keep.

Gem should do the following:

Compile list of companies hiring for dev jobs in a given city.
Write companies to spreadsheet for reference later => cold calling, networking, etc.
User should be able to specify city/state + key words

Basic UI
user types in scrape_indeed
user is prompted for city/state
user is prompted for keywords
scraper output is written to csv or excel file
